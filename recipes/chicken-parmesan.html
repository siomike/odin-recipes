    <p>Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. 
        And while this delicious meal may sestrong fancy, 
        it's actually pretty easy to make at home.</p>

    <h1>Chef John's Top Tips for Making Chicken Parmesan</h1>
    <p>Before we get to the recipe, here's your cheat sheet for making the best baked chicken Parmesan:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pound chicken to an even thickness:</strong> Pound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. Basically, you're pounding the thick part down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't skimp on seasoning:</strong> Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs</strong>: Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken, the Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest before cooking:</strong> Before frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the chicken breast.</li>
        <li><strong>Go easy on the sauce:</strong> THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good thing is too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese?</li>
        <li><strong>Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot</strong>: Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F. You'll want the cheese to brown slightly and the breading to crisp up before the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot oven is the way to go.
        </li>
    </ol>
