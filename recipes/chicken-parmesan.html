    <p>Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. 
        And while this delicious meal may sestrong fancy, 
        it's actually pretty easy to make at home.</p>

    <h1>Chef John's Top Tips for Making Chicken Parmesan</h1>
    <p>Before we get to the recipe, here's your cheat sheet for making the best baked chicken Parmesan:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pound chicken to an even thickness:</strong> Pound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. Basically, you're pounding the thick part down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't skimp on seasoning:</strong> Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs</strong>: Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken, the Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest before cooking:</strong> Before frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the chicken breast.</li>
        <li><strong>Go easy on the sauce:</strong> THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good thing is too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese?</li>
        <li><strong>Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot</strong>: Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F. You'll want the cheese to brown slightly and the breading to crisp up before the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot oven is the way to go.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
        salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
        2 large eggs
        1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed
        ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
        2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed
        ½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed
        ½ cup prepared tomato sauce
        ¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes
        ¼ cup chopped fresh basil
        ½ cup grated provolone cheese
        2 teaspoons olive oil
    </ul>
        <ul>4 cups peeled, cubed sweet potatoes</ul>
        <ul>2 large eggs, beaten</ul>
        <ul>½ cup white sugar</ul>
        <ul>½ cup milk</ul>
        <ul>4 tablespoons butter, softened</ul>
        <ul>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</ul>
        <ul>½ teaspoon salt</ul>

    <h3>Pecan Topping</h3>
        <ul>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</ul>
        <ul>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</ul>
        <ul>3 tbsp butter, softened</ul>
        <ul>1/2 cup chopped pecans</ul>

     
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of 
            heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. 
            Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch..</li>
        <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. 
            Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, 
            evenly coating both sides</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. 
            Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside. 
            Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, 
            pressing crumbs into both sides. 
            Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. 
            Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. 
            The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. 
                Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. 
            Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are 
            no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        
    </ol>
